# Simple-Library-Management-System

This project is a basic Java-based Library Management System that allows users to perform three main operations: add books, add library members, and borrow books. It was developed to practice fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structure handling, and programming logic in Java.

Key features:

Add book data to the system (title, author, book ID).

Add library member data (name, member ID).

Borrowing functionality with book availability check.

Utilizes Java class structures and lists to temporarily store data (non-database).

This project is implemented as a console application, ideal for beginner learning before moving to GUI-based or web-based development.
